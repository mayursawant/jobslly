The AI engineer successfully progressed the Jobslly platform from a redesign challenge to a highly polished application. Initially, the task involved redesigning pages based on , starting with . After overcoming a file content mismatch error, the AI iteratively redesigned the homepage, job listing, blog listing, login, and registration pages, incorporating a clean, minimalist, healthcare-focused aesthetic with animations. A crucial phase involved integrating Dr. Akram Ahmad's branding and a lead-generation chatbot, which required several fixes for auto-opening and functionality. Subsequent work addressed numerous user-reported bugs and feature requests, including job posting form validations, footer link fixes (sitemap, legal links), job category filters, image uploads for blogs, removal of save job functionality, and meticulous updates to the logo, favicon, and footer contact details. The trajectory concludes with the AI verifying the updated header logo and preparing to verify the footer updates.
