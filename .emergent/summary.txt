The previous AI engineer's work spanned several iterations, evolving the Jobslly platform from initial UI/UX fixes to complex feature implementations and persistent bug resolutions. Key phases included addressing frontend rendering issues (blog images, clickability), implementing a robust job application tracking system (for both logged-in and logged-out users, including dashboard integration), and upgrading the blog CMS with an advanced rich text editor. The work also focused on SEO improvements (URL restructuring, job slugs, 404 page), fixing numerous backend syntax errors, and resolving database connectivity issues. The trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to debugging and feature development, prioritizing user feedback and ensuring end-to-end functionality.

The Jobslly platform, an AI-powered healthcare job board, aims to connect healthcare professionals with opportunities, inspired by 's UI/UX. The initial phase focused on a Swaasa-inspired redesign, integrating AI for lead generation and job description enhancement (though a chatbot was later removed).

Implemented features include:
-   **User Management**: Unified login, phone number collection, role-based redirects.
-   **Job Management**: Category filters, soft-delete, conditional application flow, admin job management, HTTPS URL validation.
-   **Blog Management**: Image uploads, resolution fixes, full tile clickability, and an advanced rich text editor for content creation.
-   **Job Seeker Dashboard**: Revamped profile display, profile completion syncing with backend, and a dedicated section to view applied jobs.
-   **SEO**: Transitioning  to , creating SEO-friendly job URLs (slugs), a functional contact form, and a custom 404 error page.
-   **System Fixes**: Resolved authentication token mismatches, Nginx 404s, MongoDB connection issues, and various backend syntax errors.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/Styling**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, custom CSS, Jodit React (for rich text editing).
-   **Authentication/Authorization**: JWT tokens, .
-   **Routing**: , Nginx for client-side routing, FastAPI routers.
-   **Data Handling**: , UUIDs, ISO datetime strings,  for temporary state.
-   **Deployment**: Supervisor, Kubernetes ingress, AWS.

<code_architecture>
**High-Level Architecture**:
The application leverages a MERN-like stack with React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence. Frontend and backend communicate via RESTful APIs, with backend routes prefixed by  to align with Kubernetes ingress rules. Backend handles all database interactions using environment variables for connection. Nginx serves the React application and acts as a reverse proxy for backend API calls, also managing client-side routing.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the full employer dashboard with features for shortlisting candidates, viewing resumes, and analytics (mentioned as pending, not explicitly requested to work on in this trajectory).
-   Complete frontend E2E testing and user flow validation (automated frontend testing was not explicitly run for all changes).
-   Implement backend API endpoint and frontend integration for the contact form to actually send emails or store messages (backend endpoint is created, but no email sending or storage logic).
-   Address crawling issues and integrate GA & Search Console verification/tracking codes.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with and has just begun working on two new items:
1.  **URL Structure Update**: Change the  route to  for uniformity.
2.  **GA & Search Console Setup**: Implement Google Analytics and Search Console verification and tracking codes on all pages to improve crawlability and SEO performance. The user provided the specific Google tag script for implementation.

The AI engineer has successfully changed the  route to  in the frontend (App.js, Navbar) and backend (server.py) but has not yet fully integrated the contact form's submission logic or started on the GA/Search Console setup. The  component has been created, and the route updated, but the form itself is only a placeholder. The primary focus of the previous actions was to fix several critical bugs related to job loading, login credentials, and blog display that emerged after the previous set of major changes (URL restructuring, contact form, job slugs, 404 page). The AI successfully fixed multiple Python syntax errors in  and confirmed that core APIs for jobs, blogs, and login are now functioning correctly.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue working on the Contact Form by implementing the backend logic to process submissions for the  endpoint and then integrate the Google Analytics tracking code into the frontend.
