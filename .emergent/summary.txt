<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial high-level goal was to improve the job portal's SEO, which led to a series of complex technical challenges. After resolving a critical application outage caused by a failed server-side rendering (SSR) attempt, the user shifted priorities to feature development and UI enhancements.

The key tasks addressed in this session were:
1.  **System Recovery:** Fixing a completely broken preview environment by reverting a failed Next.js migration and stabilizing the frontend and backend services.
2.  **New Feature Development:** Building a premium, recruiter-focused Student Profiles page from scratch with detailed, hardcoded profiles, expandable sections, and a contact modal.
3.  **UI/UX Overhaul:** Refactoring the homepage to remove complex animations (GSAP), fix layout issues, update content and imagery, and align the visual theme with user requests.
4.  **Architectural Cleanup:** Removing all server-side rendering (SSR) logic from the Python backend to simplify the architecture after it caused persistent issues.
5.  **Critical Bug Fixes:**
    *   Resolving a flash of unstyled content (FOUC) on page load.
    *   Diagnosing and fixing a critical database connection issue where the application was connecting to a local, empty database instead of the production database, causing all data-driven features (jobs, blogs, login) to fail.
6.  **Feature Implementation:** Adding an automatic job archiving system where jobs expire and are archived based on a new  date field.
7.  **Content Updates:** Updating contact information, office addresses, and the  file as requested by the user.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack job portal using React (Create-React-App) for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, connected to a production MongoDB Atlas database. All major critical issues from the previous sessions, including the broken preview, database connection failures, and service crashes, have been resolved. The application is now stable and functional. The agent has successfully implemented a new Student Profiles page, an auto-archiving job feature (backend-only), and has performed a significant UI cleanup on the homepage. The last action was updating the About Us section on the homepage with a new image provided by the user.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The user requested to update the image in the About Jobslly section on the homepage and fix the vertical alignment between the new image and the adjacent text block. The agent has replaced the image URL in the code but has not yet addressed or verified the alignment fix.
-   Status: 
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool. The agent needs to visually inspect the homepage to confirm that the height of the image container matches the height of the text container and that they are correctly aligned.
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: (P0) Misalignment in Homepage About Us Section**
    -   **Issues Detail:**
        -   **Issue 1:**
            -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent successfully replaced the image URL in . The alignment issue remains unaddressed.
            -   **Next debug checklist:**
                1.  Review the JSX and CSS for the About Us section in .
                2.  Apply flexbox or grid CSS properties to the parent container to ensure its children (image and text blocks) have equal height. A class like  on a flex container is a good approach.
                3.  Ensure the image itself is styled with  and  with  to fill its container without distortion.
                4.  Use the  to visually confirm the alignment and equal heights.
            -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To resolve the user's direct visual feedback and ensure the homepage has a professional and polished look.
            -   **Status:** 
            -   **Is recurring issue?** N
            -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
            -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **Task 1 (P1): Implement Frontend for Job Expiry Date**
    -   **Description:** The backend now supports an  field and auto-archives jobs. However, there is no UI for administrators to set this date when creating or editing a job. This task involves adding a date picker to the job creation/editing form in the admin panel.
    -   **File Reference:** The admin job form (likely located in a component for ). The backend endpoint is .
    -   **Priority:** P1 - This is a missing part of a requested feature.

**Future Tasks:**
-   **Task 2 (P2): Fix 404 Error on Admin Dashboard**
    -   **Description:** The frontend testing agent reported multiple times that navigating to  results in a 404 Not Found error. This page is critical for managing the application.
    -   **File Reference:** Check the routing in  and the component associated with the admin route.
    -   **Priority:** P2 - This is a likely regression that breaks core administrative functionality.
-   **Task 3 (P2): Add Visual Indicator for Archived Jobs**
    -   **Description:** This is a pending UI task from a previous session. It requires adding a visual badge or indicator on job cards to show when a job has been archived.
    -   **Priority:** P2 - A nice-to-have feature that completes the job lifecycle visibility.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Critical System Recovery**: Stabilized the entire application by fixing supervisor configurations, restoring missing scripts, and correctly configuring environment variables for all services (frontend, backend, database).
-   **Next.js Migration Reversal**: Removed all traces of a failed Next.js migration, restoring the project to a stable Create-React-App structure.
-   **New Feature: Student Profiles Page**: Created, styled, and populated a new, responsive page at  with 15 candidate profiles, expandable sections, and a contact modal.
-   **Homepage UI Overhaul**:
    -   Removed the  library and simplified animations for better performance.
    -   Replaced emojis with  for a more professional look.
    -   Fixed the layout of the stats section to display correctly in a single row.
    -   Updated the About Us section content and image as per user request.
-   **Architecture Simplification**: Removed all server-side rendering (SSR) logic from the backend (), eliminating a major source of complexity and errors.
-   **FOUC Bug Fix**: Solved the flash of unstyled content by cleaning up .
-   **Database Connection Fix**: Diagnosed and fixed the critical issue preventing the app from connecting to the production database by correcting the  file.
-   **Feature: Job Auto-Archiving (Backend)**: Implemented a background scheduler in FastAPI to automatically archive jobs based on a new  date.
-   **Content Updates**: Updated , contact information (email/phone), and office addresses across the application.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Admin Dashboard is Inaccessible (404 Error)**
    -   **Debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify the route for  exists in .
        2.  Check the component being rendered for that route to ensure it's imported and functions correctly.
        3.  Confirm if any API calls within the admin component are failing and causing a redirect or error boundary to trigger.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** The admin dashboard is essential for managing jobs, users, and other application content. Fixing it will restore core administrative capabilities.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend.
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: The architectural mismatch between a CRA frontend and SSR backend was a major recurring issue.
-   **Recurrence count**: This problem persisted for a long time.
-   **Status**: . The agent resolved this not by fixing the mismatch but by entirely removing the SSR functionality from the backend, thus eliminating the root cause of the conflict. The application now functions as a standard Single Page Application (SPA).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **React (Create-React-App)**: The frontend is a standard SPA built with CRA.
-   **FastAPI & MongoDB**: The backend provides a REST API and connects to a MongoDB Atlas database.
-   **Supervisor**: This is the process control system for the container. **It is the source of truth for environment variables like **, overriding any  files.
-   **Ingress Routing & Proxy**: Frontend API calls are made to relative paths (e.g., ). The  file handles this in the local dev environment, while the platform's ingress controller handles it in the deployed preview, routing requests to the backend service. This was a key learning.

-   **/etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisor.conf**: **Crucial file**. Edited to fix the production database connection. Any service-level environment issues likely originate here.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Edited to use a relative path for the backend URL, which is critical for the preview to work.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The job auto-archiving feature is incomplete. The backend logic is present, but there is no frontend UI for admins to set the  date, making the feature unusable in practice.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Environment Configuration is Key:** The most significant challenge in this session was debugging environment and configuration issues. Remember:
    *   The  file () overrides  files for service environment variables like .
    *   The frontend must use a relative path for API calls (i.e.,  in  should be empty). The platform's ingress routes  requests to the backend. Hardcoding external URLs caused persistent SSL and connectivity issues.
2.  **Admin Dashboard is Broken:** The  route returns a 404. This is a high-priority regression that needs to be investigated.
3.  **Job Archiving is Incomplete:** The backend logic for job archiving exists, but the frontend part (letting an admin set the expiry date) is missing. This task needs to be completed to make the feature functional.
