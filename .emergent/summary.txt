The trajectory documents an extensive, multi-sprint development cycle on the Jobslly application, starting from a baseline with SEO and URL standardization fixes. The work was highly iterative, driven by a continuous stream of user feedback and evolving requirements.

Initially, the focus was on adding a currency selector (USD/INR) and fixing the sitemap domain. This evolved into a more complex set of requirements: allowing jobs to have multiple categories and converting salary fields from numeric to flexible text inputs. This change introduced a  in the backend due to a data type mismatch (Pydantic models expecting  but receiving  from the database), which was a recurring issue and had to be fixed in multiple API endpoints by casting integers to strings.

Subsequently, the user requested re-introducing a currency selector alongside the text-based salary, leading to the implementation of a smart currency symbol display logic in the frontend. Significant effort was then dedicated to major UI/UX enhancements on the homepage, including a custom-branded hero image and a highly interactive, animated Courses section built with complex CSS and React state management. This section went through several iterations to perfect its hover/click behavior, animation smoothness, and layout.

The final phase involved debugging and refining the job listing functionality, implementing pagination with a Load More button, ensuring jobs are sorted by date, and fixing server-side category filtering. The very last interaction identified the root cause of a persistent filter bug: inconsistent category naming within the MongoDB database. The user's primary language is English; future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The product is Jobslly, an AI-powered healthcare job board inspired by , designed to connect healthcare professionals with employers.

**Implemented Core Functionality:**
-   **Job & Blog Platform:** A full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend, featuring job listings, a blog/CMS, and an admin panel for content management.
-   **Multi-Category Job Postings:** Jobs can be assigned to multiple categories (e.g., Doctors, Nurses). The frontend job board supports filtering by these categories.
-   **Flexible Salary Fields:** Job salaries are stored as text to accommodate both numeric ranges (e.g., 1,500,000 - 2,500,000) and descriptive text (e.g., Negotiable). A currency selector (INR/USD) is available. The frontend intelligently displays a currency symbol (₹ or $) only when the salary text contains numbers.
-   **Interactive Homepage:** The homepage features an updated hero image and a highly engaging, animated Courses section. This section has two interactive blocks that, on hover, expand and reveal a 2x2 grid of relevant course tiles linking to an external site.
-   **Paginated Job Listings:** The main job board fetches jobs in batches (limit of 50) and includes a Load More button for infinite scrolling. Jobs are sorted with the newest first.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack:** React (frontend), FastAPI (Python backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Data Modeling & Validation:** Pydantic models for API data validation, which required careful handling of data type mismatches (int vs. str) between the database and application logic.
- **Frontend State Management:** Extensive use of React Hooks (, ) to manage complex UI state for animations, hover effects, and data fetching with pagination.
- **Advanced CSS & Animations:** Custom CSS animations (), transitions, and hover-based interactions to create a dynamic and premium user experience in the Courses section.
- **API Development:** REST API design including pagination (, ), sorting, and filtering logic for fetching job data.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. Nginx serves as the web server.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The core backend application. It defines all API endpoints, Pydantic data models, and database interactions.
    - **Summary of Changes**:
        - **Job Model**: The  Pydantic model was heavily modified.  and  were changed from  to . A single  field was replaced with . A  field was added.
        - ** Endpoint**: Updated to accept a  query parameter to filter jobs. Added pagination (, ) and sorting (, descending).
        - **Data Type Casting**: Added  casting logic to all job-fetching endpoints (, , , etc.) to prevent Pydantic  when retrieving older jobs with integer-based salaries.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The main landing page component. It was significantly overhauled for UI/UX.
    - **Summary of Changes**:
        - **Hero Image**: The main hero image was updated to a user-provided branded image.
        - **Interactive Course Section**: A new, complex component () was created and added. It features two side-by-side blocks with hover-activated animations that reveal a 2x2 grid of course tiles. This involved custom CSS animations, group-hover logic, and React state management for the hover interactions.
        - **Job Card Alignment**: The Latest Jobs section was updated with Flexbox to ensure all job cards have equal height and their View Details buttons are aligned at the bottom.
        - **Salary Display**: Implemented a  helper function to intelligently show/hide currency symbols.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: Displays the main list of jobs with filters. It was updated to handle pagination and fix filtering.
    - **Summary of Changes**:
        - **Pagination**: Implemented  state and a  function. The API call was updated to use  and . The Load More button now appends new jobs to the list and hides when no more jobs are available. The default limit was set to 50.
        - **Category Filtering**: The  hook that fetches jobs was updated to pass the selected category to the backend API, offloading the filtering logic from the client to the server. The local filtering logic was removed.
        - **Salary Display**: Added the  helper function to handle smart currency symbol display.

- ****:
    - **Importance**: The interface for creating and managing jobs.
    - **Summary of Changes**:
        - **Form Fields**: The job creation and editing forms were updated to use a multi-select component for  and a text input for /, alongside a  dropdown.
        - **Validation**: Numeric validation for salary was removed. A check was added to ensure at least one category is selected. A bug ( not defined) was fixed by sending the salary text directly to the API.

<pending_tasks>
- Standardize the job category names in the MongoDB database to fix the filtering issue on the Opportunities page. This involves creating and running a migration script to consolidate inconsistent names (e.g., merge  and  into a single, standard name like ).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was debugging why category filters on the Opportunities page were not working for pharmacists, physiotherapists, and dentists, and why doctors and nurses filters showed incomplete results.

The previous engineer correctly diagnosed the root cause of this problem. By querying the database for all unique category values, it was discovered that the data was inconsistent. For example, the database contained jobs with both  and  as categories, and  and . The frontend filter was only using one version of the name, causing jobs with the other version to be missed.

The last action taken was identifying these inconsistencies. The immediate next step is to clean and standardize this data in the database to ensure the filters work reliably.

<optional_next_step>
Create and execute a Python script to migrate and standardize all  values in the MongoDB  collection to resolve the filtering inconsistencies.
