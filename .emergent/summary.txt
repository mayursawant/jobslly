<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully resolved critical authentication and data loading issues within the CMS Admin Dashboard. This involved:
1.  **Debugging Admin Dashboard Data Loading**: Identified and fixed the root cause of the Failed to load data error in the Admin Dashboard, which was an authentication token mismatch ( vs. ) in the  component.
2.  **Fixing Admin Blog Posting/Management Permissions**: Ensured admin users have correct authentication and permissions to post, edit, and delete blog articles. This involved verifying backend role checks and updating frontend API calls in  to send the correct authentication headers.
3.  **Refining CMS Login**: Updated the  component to include the correct default admin credentials ( / ) for testing and added a  to the login form for automated testing.
4.  **Removing Refresh Logic**: Removed problematic refresh logic from  that was interfering with stable data loading.

The AI engineer successfully tested these fixes through a targeted comprehensive test, confirming that the CMS Admin Dashboard is now loading data correctly and that admin users can perform blog management operations with proper authentication. The product state is that all core features and recent bug fixes are implemented and verified.
