The AI engineer successfully developed Jobslly, a full-stack healthcare job platform, through multiple iterative cycles. Initial development established core features like user authentication (job seeker, employer, admin), AI-driven job descriptions and chatbot functionality, and basic job listing. Debugging efforts addressed backend issues, notably fixing  password hashing. The UI, initially a dark futuristic theme, was refined into a light, professional design using Shadcn UI and custom animations, incorporating user feedback on readability and contrast. A robust CMS was integrated for job posting, blog management with advanced editing, and foundational SEO (meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt). User-specific dashboards for job seekers and employers were created. The most recent focus was on implementing a lead collection mechanism, requiring users to log in before applying for jobs, and verifying SEO endpoints, though sitemap verification showed an issue.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on addressing user feedback regarding UI contrast and implementing a lead collection mechanism, alongside improving SEO.
1.  **UI Contrast**: The application's styling (, , ) was updated from a dark to a light, futuristic theme. This significantly improved text readability on the background, confirmed by screenshots showing clear text on white/light blue gradients.
2.  **Lead Collection**: A new  component was introduced. The  component was modified to integrate this modal. Now, when a non-logged-in user clicks Apply Now on a job listing, the modal appears, prompting them to log in or register to proceed.
3.  **SEO Improvements**: Dynamic  and  endpoints were added to the backend (), and  was integrated into  for enhanced meta tag management.
4.  **Verification**: The AI attempted to verify the  and  endpoints. The  was found to be incorrectly served by the React app, not the backend. The  endpoint was tested via  to the backend, confirming backend connectivity but not the actual content of the  file itself.

The immediate next step in the trajectory is to test the full user flow of the  by clicking the Apply Now button on a job details page.
