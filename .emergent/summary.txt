The AI engineer's trajectory involved a series of iterative development cycles, starting with comprehensive documentation updates, then moving into significant bug fixes and feature enhancements across the Jobslly platform. Key challenges included troubleshooting MongoDB Atlas connection issues, rectifying authentication token mismatches (access_token vs. token) in frontend components like  and , and addressing frontend routing ( on refresh) via Nginx configuration. Subsequent work focused on refining user experience, such as consolidating logout/login flows, integrating phone number collection during registration, and implementing robust URL validation for job posts. The work concluded with fixing image resolution on blog pages and improving blog tile clickability, indicating a focus on UI/UX and content management system functionality.

<code_architecture>
**High-Level Architecture**:
The application uses a standard MERN-like stack: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Frontend and backend communicate via RESTful APIs, with all backend endpoints strictly prefixed by  to work with Kubernetes ingress. MongoDB interactions are handled exclusively by the backend, utilizing environment variables for connection. Nginx serves the frontend and proxies requests to the backend, handling client-side routing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two issues related to the blog listing page ():
1.  **Blog Image Resolution:** The user reported that blog images on the blog listing page were not displaying with correct resolution.
2.  **Blog Tile Clickability:** The user requested that clicking anywhere on a blog's complete tile on the listing page should open the blog, instead of only the Read Full Article button.

The AI engineer has begun investigating these issues in the  component, specifically looking at patterns related to ,  text, and  navigation to understand the current implementation of the blog cards and images.
