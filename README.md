---

## 🌐 Deployment & Infrastructure

### Production Environment (Emergent Platform)
```yaml
Platform URL: https://recruiter-portal.preview.emergentagent.com
Infrastructure: Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling
Container Runtime: Docker with supervisor process management
Database: MongoDB (local instance)
Backend Port: 8001 (internal, mapped externally)
Frontend Port: 3000 (internal, mapped externally)
SSL/TLS: Automatic certificate management via Kubernetes ingress
Monitoring: Real-time supervisor logs and health checks
```

### Deployment on Emergent Platform

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
The Emergent platform pre-configures environment variables. **DO NOT modify these:**

**Backend `.env` (pre-configured)**
```bash
MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"
DB_NAME="test_database"
JWT_SECRET="healthcare_jobs_secret_key_change_in_production"
EMERGENT_LLM_KEY="sk-emergent-<your-key>"
CORS_ORIGINS="*"
```

**Frontend `.env` (pre-configured)**
```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="https://recruiter-portal.preview.emergentagent.com"
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
```

#### Step 2: Service Management with Supervisor
All services are managed by supervisor in the Emergent platform:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo supervisorctl status
# Output:
# backend    RUNNING   pid 123, uptime 1:23:45
# frontend   RUNNING   pid 456, uptime 1:23:45

# Restart services after code changes
sudo supervisorctl restart backend    # Restart backend only
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend   # Restart frontend only
sudo supervisorctl restart all        # Restart all services

# Stop services
sudo supervisorctl stop backend
sudo supervisorctl stop all

# Start services
sudo supervisorctl start backend
sudo supervisorctl start all

# View live logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stderr    # Backend error logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stdout    # Backend output logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f frontend stdout   # Frontend logs

# Check log files directly
tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log
tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log
tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/frontend.out.log
```

#### Step 3: Hot Reload Behavior
- **Backend**: FastAPI has hot reload enabled - changes are auto-detected
- **Frontend**: React has hot reload enabled - changes are auto-detected
- **When to restart:**
  - After installing new Python packages (`pip install`)
  - After installing new Node packages (`yarn add`)
  - After modifying `.env` files
  - After supervisor configuration changes

#### Step 4: Health Checks
```bash
# Backend health check
curl https://recruiter-portal.preview.emergentagent.com/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "2025-10-05T10:30:00Z"}

# Check backend API documentation
# Visit: https://recruiter-portal.preview.emergentagent.com/docs
```

#### Step 5: Troubleshooting Deployment

**Service not starting:**
```bash
# Check supervisor logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stderr

# Common issues:
# - Missing dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
# - Port already in use: Check for conflicting processes
# - MongoDB not running: sudo systemctl start mongod
```

**Changes not reflecting:**
```bash
# Clear browser cache for frontend changes
# Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (macOS)

# Restart services
sudo supervisorctl restart all

# Check if hot reload is working
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stdout
# Look for "Uvicorn running" and file change detection messages
```

**Database connection issues:**
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
sudo systemctl status mongod

# Test MongoDB connection
mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"

# Check connection string in .env
cat /app/backend/.env | grep MONGO_URL
```

### Kubernetes Ingress Routing

The Emergent platform uses Kubernetes ingress with specific routing rules:

```yaml
# All requests to /api/* → Backend (port 8001)
# All other requests → Frontend (port 3000)

# CRITICAL: All backend API routes MUST start with /api
# Example:
# ✅ /api/jobs         → Backend
# ✅ /api/auth/login   → Backend
# ✅ /api/blog         → Backend
# ❌ /jobs             → Frontend (404 error!)
```

### Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured correctly
- [ ] Dependencies installed (Python + Node)
- [ ] MongoDB running and accessible
- [ ] Services started via supervisor
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding
- [ ] Frontend accessible in browser
- [ ] Backend API documentation accessible at `/docs`
