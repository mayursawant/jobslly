## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 16.x or higher
- **Python** 3.9 or higher  
- **MongoDB** (local or Atlas)
- **Git** for version control
- **Yarn** package manager (recommended over npm)

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/academically-global/jobslly.git
cd jobslly

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies (use yarn, not npm)
cd ../frontend
yarn install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### Backend Environment (`backend/.env`)
```bash
MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"
DB_NAME="jobslly_database"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-change-in-production"
EMERGENT_LLM_KEY="your-emergent-llm-key-here"
CORS_ORIGINS="*"
```

#### Frontend Environment (`frontend/.env`)
```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8001"
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
```

**Important Notes:**
- Never modify `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` or `MONGO_URL` in production - these are pre-configured
- All backend API routes must be prefixed with `/api` for proper routing
- Get your Emergent LLM Key from the Emergent platform dashboard

### 3. Database Initialization
```bash
# MongoDB will auto-create collections on first run
# Start MongoDB service (if running locally)
sudo systemctl start mongod  # Linux
brew services start mongodb-community  # macOS

# Sample data will be automatically populated on first run
```

### 4. Start Development Servers

#### Option A: Local Development (Manual Start)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend Server
cd backend
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload

# Terminal 2: Frontend Server
cd frontend  
yarn start
```

#### Option B: Using Supervisor (Production-like)
```bash
# Check service status
sudo supervisorctl status

# Start all services
sudo supervisorctl start all

# Restart individual services
sudo supervisorctl restart backend
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend

# View logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stderr
sudo supervisorctl tail -f frontend stdout
```

  return enhanced.enhanced_description;
};
```

---

## üåê Deployment & Infrastructure

### Production Environment (Emergent Platform)
```yaml
Platform URL: https://jobslly-health-1.preview.emergentagent.com
Infrastructure: Kubernetes cluster with auto-scaling
Container Runtime: Docker with supervisor process management
Database: MongoDB (local instance)
Backend Port: 8001 (internal, mapped externally)
Frontend Port: 3000 (internal, mapped externally)
SSL/TLS: Automatic certificate management via Kubernetes ingress
Monitoring: Real-time supervisor logs and health checks
```

### Deployment on Emergent Platform

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
The Emergent platform pre-configures environment variables. **DO NOT modify these:**

**Backend `.env` (pre-configured)**
```bash
MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"
DB_NAME="test_database"
JWT_SECRET="healthcare_jobs_secret_key_change_in_production"
EMERGENT_LLM_KEY="sk-emergent-<your-key>"
CORS_ORIGINS="*"
```

**Frontend `.env` (pre-configured)**
```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL="https://jobslly-health-1.preview.emergentagent.com"
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
```

#### Step 2: Service Management with Supervisor
All services are managed by supervisor in the Emergent platform:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo supervisorctl status
# Output:
# backend    RUNNING   pid 123, uptime 1:23:45
# frontend   RUNNING   pid 456, uptime 1:23:45

# Restart services after code changes
sudo supervisorctl restart backend    # Restart backend only
sudo supervisorctl restart frontend   # Restart frontend only
sudo supervisorctl restart all        # Restart all services

# Stop services
sudo supervisorctl stop backend
sudo supervisorctl stop all

# Start services
sudo supervisorctl start backend
sudo supervisorctl start all

# View live logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stderr    # Backend error logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stdout    # Backend output logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f frontend stdout   # Frontend logs

# Check log files directly
tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log
tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log
tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/frontend.out.log
```

#### Step 3: Hot Reload Behavior
- **Backend**: FastAPI has hot reload enabled - changes are auto-detected
- **Frontend**: React has hot reload enabled - changes are auto-detected
- **When to restart:**
  - After installing new Python packages (`pip install`)
  - After installing new Node packages (`yarn add`)
  - After modifying `.env` files
  - After supervisor configuration changes

#### Step 4: Health Checks
```bash
# Backend health check
curl https://jobslly-health-1.preview.emergentagent.com/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "2025-10-05T10:30:00Z"}

# Check backend API documentation
# Visit: https://jobslly-health-1.preview.emergentagent.com/docs
```

#### Step 5: Troubleshooting Deployment

**Service not starting:**
```bash
# Check supervisor logs
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stderr

# Common issues:
# - Missing dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
# - Port already in use: Check for conflicting processes
# - MongoDB not running: sudo systemctl start mongod
```

**Changes not reflecting:**
```bash
# Clear browser cache for frontend changes
# Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (macOS)

# Restart services
sudo supervisorctl restart all

# Check if hot reload is working
sudo supervisorctl tail -f backend stdout
# Look for "Uvicorn running" and file change detection messages
```

**Database connection issues:**
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
sudo systemctl status mongod

# Test MongoDB connection
mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"

# Check connection string in .env
cat /app/backend/.env | grep MONGO_URL
```

### Kubernetes Ingress Routing

The Emergent platform uses Kubernetes ingress with specific routing rules:

```yaml
# All requests to /api/* ‚Üí Backend (port 8001)
# All other requests ‚Üí Frontend (port 3000)

# CRITICAL: All backend API routes MUST start with /api
# Example:
# ‚úÖ /api/jobs         ‚Üí Backend
# ‚úÖ /api/auth/login   ‚Üí Backend
# ‚úÖ /api/blog         ‚Üí Backend
# ‚ùå /jobs             ‚Üí Frontend (404 error!)
```
